# Web_Security_Project
<h2>Pizza Restaurant </h2>
<p> <b>CYS 538</b> 
<br> We've made a Pizza restaurant webpage to apply a vulnerable assessment over it and then patch any vulnerability that has been found. <br>
In this project, We were keen to implement secure coding practices and follow the guidelines
that provided by OWASP to have a secure website.
