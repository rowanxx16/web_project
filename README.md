# Web-Security-Project
<h2>Gamer's store</h2>
<p>This project has been made to fulfil one of the requirements of the Web Technology and Security Course - <b>CYS 538</b> 
<br> We've made a website store to apply a vulnerable assessment over it and then patch any vulnerability that has been found. <br>
In this project, We were keen to implement secure coding practices and follow the guidelines
that provided by OWASP to have a secure website. 
I recommend previewing the report pdf file to understand the project entirely.
